# taskbox
My kids are very list driven. I'm trying to save paper. Desired end result: a program that will accept an arbitrary number of tasks, take that list, generate an array of labeled buttons with boolean clicked states for each item, and then display and update them. Once all tasks are mouse clicked=true, perform a cute animation and ask to reset.
